# Introduction

For my final project in bootcamp, I am tasked to:

*Research job postings for Jr. Web Developer and Jr. Full-Stack Engineer in your area and try to find technology being requested that wasn't covered in this class.  Build a project using as many of these new technologies as you can.*

Based on this requirement, I looked through the course material and the job postings.  Based on my research, I landed on learning:

**Java & Spring (Spring base or Spring Boot)**

My reasoning is that the material that was covered in bootcamp has revolved mainly around weakly typed languages that do not require specific matched specifications while Java requires this in its basic code.

To get started, I needed to install Java into my VM so it would work.  It took some time to develop, but I was ultimately able to complete it using:

https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/downloads/ - Site to download Java file from

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/download-install-java-windows-linux-macos/ - Tutorial for installation

Ran into some issues, main problem was downloading the incorrect Java application from the site into the system.

Once Java was running, I started to do the lessons in w3schools to help familiarize myself with Java:

# Project Plan/Build

My aim at the completion with the project is to:

| **Feature Aim** | **Description** | **Feature code requirements** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Program coded in Java | Build back-end utilizing Java and Spring as the primary code base | Java, Spring |
| Front-end/Back-end | Implement a functional, viewable app using Java/Spring that is accessible | Java, Spring, React/Angular? |
| Connect to database with CRUD function | Implement a database with CRUD functionality to this Java/Spring based program | MongoDB or SQL |
| User Authentication  | Implement a secure user authentication program into application | JWT (if using Django/SQL) or OATH2? |
| Professional look | I want to implement a CSS framework (tailwind/bootstrap/other) and use figma models to make the site look professional | Tailwind/Bootstrap, Figma model |

As I work through the initial steps and features as I learn Java, Spring, and how they interact, the features list will develop as I go.
